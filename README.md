# Vincent — Brand Site (Starter)

This repo contains a Vite + React starter with Tailwind CSS configured. I scaffolded the base project and initial components and began populating images and copy to move toward a pixel-accurate LG layout.

Quick start
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
