# Vincent — Brand Site (Starter)

This repo contains a Vite + React starter with Tailwind CSS configured. I scaffolded the base project and initial components and began populating images and copy to move toward a pixel-accurate LG layout.

Quick start
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`

Screenshots / visual regression
- To capture LG/MD/SM screenshots create a running dev server (`npm run dev`) then run:

```bash
npm i -D playwright
npm run screenshots
```

This will save `screenshots/screenshot_lg.png`, `screenshots/screenshot_md.png`, and `screenshots/screenshot_sm.png` for visual checks.

Lighthouse
- For Lighthouse audits run locally (requires Chrome):

```bash
npx lighthouse http://localhost:5174 --output html --output-path ./screenshots/lighthouse.html
```

Note: Running Lighthouse or Playwright inside this container may require additional packages (Chrome) — see the project README for guidance.

Deployment (Vercel)
- This project is ready to deploy to Vercel. Steps:

1. Push your repository to GitHub (make sure commits are visible and representative of your work).
2. Sign in to Vercel and import the GitHub repository.
3. Set the framework to "Other" or let Vercel detect Vite. Build command: `npm run build`. Output directory: `dist`.
4. Add any environment variables under Project Settings if needed.

I included a `vercel.json` with a basic static-build configuration. After deploying, copy the live URL into the README under "Live Demo".

Visual regression & CI notes
- Install `playwright` and run `npm run screenshots` to capture pages. Accept baselines with `npm run visual:accept` then use `npm run test` to compare.
